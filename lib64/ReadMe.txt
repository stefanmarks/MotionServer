As a minimum requirement, copy the 64 bit SDK library file from the NatNet SDKs here (http://www.optitrack.com/products/natnet-sdk/).
Warning: The SDK 3.0 and above have changed the protocol significantly. Use SDK v2.10 until the new version has been incorporated.
- NatNetLib.lib

If you are using other motion capture systems, add their specific 64 bit SDK library files as well.
- Cortex (MotionAnalysis)
  - Cortex_SDK.lib
